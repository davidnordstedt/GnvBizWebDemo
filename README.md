Sample application for Gainesville Business Web site.

Project is derived from a pluralsite tutorial showing how to develop using
Typescript and Angular 1.x.

Project is not set up well for continued development.  If we move forward
with this we should set something up with yeoman or something similar.
I tried this yeoman generator and I like the feel of it.

Right now you should be able to pull this down and compile and run.

Install tsc and tsd for Typescript:
npm install tsc --global
npm install tsd --global

Install http-server and run in APM directory.
npm install http-server --global
